Man said: Is this the right room for an argument?
Other Man said: I've told you once.
Man said: No you haven't!
Other Man said: Yes I have.
Man said: When?
Other Man said: Just now.
Man said: No you didn't!
Other Man said: Yes I did!
Man said: You didn't!
Other Man said: I'm telling you, I did!
Man said: You did not!
Other Man said: Oh I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour?
Man said: Ah! (taking out his wallet and paying) Just the five minutes.
Other Man said: Just the five minutes. Thank you.
Other Man said: Anyway, I did.
Man said: You most certainly did not!
